1. Defining a mechanism of delivering, retaining, accessing and utilising the acquired data mining knowledge for a further analysis.
2. Deploy the acquired knowledge and its supplement deliveries, either as intermediate results of the process iteration or as final results.
3. Knowledge deployment should be carried out according to the requirements of do- main expert and other stake holders if there are any.
4. Knowledge deployment must consider the availability and requirements of the possible knowledge delivery techniques, e.g.  software tools, data bases, hardware and expertise, as well as their constraints.
5. Knowledge  deployment  should  take  into  consideration  knowledge  utilisation  and possible future analysis.
6. Knowledge must be based on the requirements and preferences of domain expert (biologist).
7. Knowledge deployment should be carried out as a joint phase between data miner and domain expert (biologist).
