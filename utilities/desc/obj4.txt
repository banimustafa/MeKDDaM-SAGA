1. Selecting the data mining technique(s) that fulfil the defined process objectives and suit the targeted metabolomics data.
2. The selected technique performance must be measurable in model evaluation.
3. The selected technique must have the potential to achieve the defined process ob- jective.
4. The application of the selected technique must be feasible, and it must consider the process management constraints and available resources.
5. The selection procedures must be comprehensive and unbiased, and it must cover all possible data mining techniques (see section 3.4).
6. The selection strategy must be flexible and adjustable and consider the selection of alternative techniques in the case of feedback or iteration.
7. The selection of white-box data mining techniques must be encouraged over the selection of the black-box ones, as they allow more justification, reasoning, and explanation of the modelling results.
8. The selection must consider the possibility of using more than one data mining technique.
