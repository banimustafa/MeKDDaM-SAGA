1. Evaluating the data mining model validity using the decided testing data split.
2. Evaluating the data mining model achievement of the defined process objectives such as the data-driven objectives (e.g.  discover interesting or hidden patterns, trends, relationships in the data) or hypothesis driven objectives (e.g. classify samples into predefined classes or according to their natural occurrence classes)
3. Evaluating the data mining modelling success criteria defined in both objectives defi- nition and modelling techniques selection phases.
4. Evaluating the data mining model performance using different measurements.
5. Performance measurements must be correct, sufficient,  relevant and applicable to the data mining model.
6. The data mining model should be neither over-fitted nor under-fitted.
7. Model evaluation activities and procedures should be correct,  comprehensive and unbiased.
8. Model evaluation should be repeated each time a new data mining model is built or when the existing model is changed, adjusted or recreated.
