1. Assign the resources required for model building and training, which was identified in phase 4.
2. Build a data mining model with the technique selected in phase 4 and using the data split acclimatised in phase 5, which was allocated for model building and training.
3. Ensure the flexibility of the model by allowing the adjustment of its parameters.
4. Provide a justification, reasoning, or explanation for the modelling results, in the case of using a white box data mining technique.  However, when using a black box technique such as ANN, these information become harder to provide.
5. Define a mechanism for delivering the model taking into consideration the bailable modelling standards, e.g.  PMML, as well as the requirements of the process other phases, including: model evaluation, knowledge presentation, knowledge evaluation, and results deployment.
