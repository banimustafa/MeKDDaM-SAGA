            <growthProtocols>The Arabidopsis plants were grown and 
harvested by the HiMet project collaborators
 in The John Innes Centre(JIC), where the 
samples growth, harvest, extraction and 
preparation protocols were collected and 
recorded as meta-data in compliance with 
ArMet model.
The plants were grown using 9 blocks 
under a temperature of 18-23 c,
with 70\% relative humidity and 16 hours of 
day light.</growthProtocols>
            <harvestProtocols>The harvesting protocols involved collecting
 aerial tissues from the mutant plants. 
The samples metabolism were then 
quenched using liquid $N_{2}$ in mid 
light and then freezed, dried, and powdered.
 They were then shipped in a few days at 
ambient temperature, where the storage 
temperature 
was -80\textcelsius.</harvestProtocols>
            <standards>alpha-tocopherol</standards>
            <SamplePreparation>The samples were based on fractions of 
the chlorform layer extracted from the plants 
leaf. The sample preparation was 
performed
 under a temperature of 15\textcelsius. 
$\alpha$-tocopherol was used as an 
internal standard. An amount of 5mg of on 
ice were extracted in 200 $\mu L$ of 
methanol during a period of 5 minutes. 
Then a 200 $\mu L$ of 50 mM Tris-HCl was
 added during a period of 10 minutes with a
 pH of 7.5. This was followed by 800 $\mu L$
 of chloroform extract for a period of 10 
minutes. The sample then centrifuged for 5
 minutes at 3000g at 4\textcelsius. The 
choroform layer sample then transferred to 
glass vials and dried down in speedvac. 
The precipitate then re-suspended in 50 
$\mu l$ MTBE. </SamplePreparation>

            <info>The dried layers of chloroform 
were analysed on a 250-mm 
(4.6mmi.d.) using C30
 column 
(5 $\mu m$YMC30;YMC), 
at a flow rate of 1 ml$min^{-1}$, 
with 0.2\% formic acid and
 20mM ammonium formate 
in 80\%methanol, or methyl 
tertiary-butyl ether (solvent B)
 as 0\% for a period of 6 minutes,
 15\% for a period of 5 minutes
, to 90\% for a period of 30 
minutes, and 90\% for a
 period of 5 minutes. 
The quantification of the 
isoprenoids were conducted 
using positive-ion atmospheric 
pressure chemical ionisation 
MS using capillary at 15 V 
and 150\textcelsius, and 
using a vaporiser at 
500\textcelsius, and 
discharge current of
